## How to Contribute

Here are several ways you can contribute:

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, typo, or incorrect logic:

1. Check existing [Issues](https://github.com/dimpeshmalviya/JavaBasicPrograms/issues) to see if it has already been reported.
2. If it's new, open a new issue with:
   - A descriptive title  
   - Steps to reproduce  
   - Expected vs actual behavior  
   - (Optional) Suggested fix  

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you want to introduce a new Java program or pattern:

1. Open an issue proposing the feature.
2. Describe:
   - What you want to add (e.g. ‚ÄúAdd Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm in Java‚Äù)  
   - Why it‚Äôs valuable  
   - Any references or sample inputs/outputs  

### Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

When you‚Äôre ready to contribute code changes:

1. **Fork** the repository  
2. Create a descriptive **branch name**, e.g.  
```

feature/binary-tree-traversal
bugfix/fix-prime-check
docs/add-contributing-guidelines

```
3. Make your changes. Commit with meaningful messages, e.g.  
```

feat: add in-order, pre-order, post-order tree traversals
fix: correct off-by-one in prime-check logic

```
4. Push your branch to your fork.  
5. Open a **Pull Request** against the main repository's `main` (or master) branch.  
6. In the PR description, include:
- What your change does  
- Why it‚Äôs needed  
- Any limitations or trade-offs  
- Example input/output if applicable  

PRs will be reviewed by maintainers. We may ask for small improvements or clarifications before merging.

---

## Development Workflow

- All contributions should target the `main` branch via PRs  
- Keep your fork up-to-date with `main` before starting work  
- Use rebasing or merging to resolve upstream changes  
- Don‚Äôt push directly to main  

---

## Coding Guidelines

To maintain consistency and readability:

- Write **clean, readable, and well-commented** code  
- Use **descriptive names** for classes, methods, and variables  
- Stick to **Java naming conventions** (e.g. `camelCase` for methods, `PascalCase` for classes)  
- Include a **header comment** at the top of each file explaining:
- Purpose of the program  
- Input & output format  
- Time/space complexity if relevant  
- If adding tests or new functionality, include sample input/output in comments  
- Avoid overly complex or obfuscated shortcuts  

You may link to a more detailed style guide (e.g. Google‚Äôs Java Style) if desired.

---

## Testing & Quality

While this repository mostly contains straightforward Java programs:

- Manually test each program after changes  
- Ensure edge cases are handled (e.g. empty inputs, large inputs)  
- If possible, include additional test cases in comments  

As the project grows, you might consider writing automated tests using JUnit or similar.

## License & Attribution

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project‚Äôs existing **MIT License**.  

Please do not include any code for which you don‚Äôt own the rights or that‚Äôs under a conflicting license.

---

## Contact & Support

If you have questions, suggestions, or need help:

- Open an **Issue**  
- Mention a maintainer (e.g. `@dimpeshmalviya`)  
- Use the repository‚Äôs Discussions (if enabled)  

Once again, thank you for helping improve **JavaBasicPrograms**. Your contributions help many learners and developers grow in Java. üôè
